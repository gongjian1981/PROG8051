## Task 1

Carlo lives in Toronto. He needed to travel on business to the cities:  Calgary, Montreal, and  
Vancouver.  Every time he needed to return to his native town before making  the next  trip. In  
August 2017, Merchant had to buy tickets for his trips:  

 - Toronto-Calgary: $1350
 - Toronto-Vancouver: $1500
 - Toronto-Montreal: $575
 
Carlo can take  an unlimited  number of trips to  each destination. You must  inquire about  the  
number of trips to each location. Consider the price  of  a round-trip.  

You need to calculate the total  money  spent by  Carlo,  and the average price of the trip he  
took.  

Attempt to use as many concepts we  learned in class as possible.  Make sure that you  use  
interactive data entry.  

## Task 2

Joe can go to an unlimited number of games and can buy any one ticket each time. You must  
inquire about the total number of each ticket type bought.
